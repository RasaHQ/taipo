# taipo

> taipo is a mispelling of typo, it means [evil spirit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taipo)

This project contains augmentation techniques to aid in the domain of mispellings
in NLP. In particular it hosts a suite of tools to generate spelling errors for Rasa. 
The hope is that algorithms can be trained on these errors and that they become 
more robust as a result.

Feedback on Non-English languages is especially appreciated!

## Roadmap

- Implement relevant tools from [nlpaug](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug) or [typo](https://pypi.org/project/typo/).
- Implement a Greek character translator.
