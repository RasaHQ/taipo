# Getting Started

The original goal of `taipo` was to augment NLU data such that we can train
Rasa models to be robust against misspellings. This guide will show you how
to train models that are robust against spelling errors.

## Installation

You can install this experiment via pip.

```
python -m pip install "taipo @ git+https://github.com/RasaHQ/taipo.git"
```
